 Welcome everyone to my new blog!
 I'm Stephanie, a Latina science educator from the Bronx.
 Embarking on a new journey to learn how to program. 
 I will be sharing bits about myself,
 along with my experiences as I start learning how to code.
  
 I'm diving straight in by learning Python.
 Data Analytics is my intended niche in the tech world. 
 Striving to use in-depth data analysis to better understand issues 
 in the STEM educational fields, to arrive at proactive solutions. 
 Hoping to develop my own STEM educational app in the future!
