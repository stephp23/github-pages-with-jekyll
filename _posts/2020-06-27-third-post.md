 I am hoping to begin my new path in tech, as a Innovation Fellowship recipient at The Knowledge House. I know that with their guidance and instruction, I will be on a path to become a successful programmer. I want to acquire the coding skills that I need to develop new interactive ways and resources to enhance the learning experience in STEM related fields. My background as a science educator has opened my eyes to the potential gaps and shortcomings in STEM education. Now more than ever, the use of technology and virtual spaces in learning is vital to a well-rounded education that can potentially teach everyone about STEM. Moreover, it can highlight how fundamental technological skills can help them thrive in many ever changing and growing tech-based/tech-influenced workforces. Once we learn with and have the tools to work with, technology allows us to breach the gap across many barriers in learning, and eventually in new developing tech industries. I want to learn from The Knowledge House, how to code and how to navigate in tech-based environments, so I can be proactive and contribute to the tech-industry and education, based on what I have learned and lived experiences. I am ready.
